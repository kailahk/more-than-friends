### How to Play

* Once you click 'Play,' you will be directed to the game page where you will have 5 seconds to view the card placements and commit any couple matches you see to memory.
* Once the cards turn over, you will be able to click two cards per turn to see if they are a match.
* If your chosen cards are not a match, they will show for 3 seconds and then flip back over, and the number of guesses you have left will reduce by 1.
* If your chosen cards are a match, they will remain face up, the names of the characters will show to the left of the board, and the name of the show will show to the right of the board.
* If you correctly choose all of the matches before you run out of guesses, you win! If not, you lose.
